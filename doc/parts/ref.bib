  abstract        = {Ecologists often face the task of studying the association between single species and one or several groups of sites representing habitat types, community types, or other categories. Besides characterizing the ecological preference of the species, the strength of the association usually presents a lot of interest for conservation biology, landscape mapping and management, and natural reserve design, among other applications. The indices most frequently employed to assess these relationships are the phi coefficient of association and the indicator value index (IndVal). We compare these two approaches by putting them into a broader framework of related measures, which includes several new indices. We present permutation tests to assess the statistical significance of species-site group associations and bootstrap methods for obtaining confidence intervals. Correlation measures, such as the phi coefficient, are more context-dependent than indicator values but allow focusing on the preference of the species. In contrast, the two components of an indicator value index directly assess the value of the species as a bioindicator because they can be interpreted as its positive predictive value and sensitivity. Ecologists should select the most appropriate index of association strength according to their objective and then compute confidence intervals to determine the precision of the estimate.},

  abstract        = {1. Bioindicators of habitat quality and environmental change must be identified quantitatively and tested independently to confirm their usefulness. We used the indicator value (IndVal) method, which combines measures of habitat fidelity and specificity, to assess the indicator responses of dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) in Tembe Elephant Park, South Africa. The indicator responses were verified by sampling in different areas of the Park, 2 years after the responses were originally quantified. 2. We postulated that terrestrial insect indicators with different combinations of habitat specificity and fidelity might fulfil different indicator roles. Indicator species with strong habitat specificity (characteristic species) are unlikely to provide information on the direction of ecological change despite high vulnerability. Rather, detector species that span a range of ecological states are likely to be better in this role. We used IndVal for selecting such detector species that indicate the direction of ecological change. 3. Sets of species were found to be robust bioindicators, i.e. reliably characteristic across the habitat of which they were indicative. The suite of indicators was refined by discarding those with IndVals that varied significantly across years, thus improving the confidence in the final suite of species selected. By clearly responding to a change in habitat between two ecological states, detector species provided information complementary to that provided by characteristic species. 4. The IndVal method enabled both the identification and testing of indicator (characteristic and detector) species. Because of its resilience to changes in abundance, IndVal is a particularly effective tool for ecological bioindication. 5. We conclude that both characteristic and detector species are useful bioindicators of habitat quality and conversion. We propose that bioindicators that are categorized and verified in this way will have valuable application in the monitoring of habitat integrity.},

  abstract        = {The indicator value (IndVal) of a species has long been the most popular measure to express species importance in community classifications. Nevertheless, a few problems concerning the original definition of IndVal still require clarification and some modifications are also in order so as to exploit the capabilities of the method more fully. In particular, we propose novel component terms (specificity, concentration and fidelity) that may be incorporated in the calculation of IndVal and also suggest some minor, although important terminological amendments. We argue that the choice among these terms should largely depend on whether the target classification is based on abundance or presence-absence data. The expanded capabilities of the approach and the sensitivity of IndVal variants to the sharpness of classifications are illustrated by actual examples coming from a benthic macroinvertebrate survey along the Danube River and a study of dolomite grassland communities in the Buda Hills, Hungary. We found that analyses by the original IndVal plus the new variants may give a more complete picture on any classification than a particular selection among component terms of IndVal. The use of several indices simultaneously is particularly recommended when selection of indicator species is the primary objective of the study. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The WFD descriptors 'System A' for stream types are too rigid and should be replaced by temperature, current, and size. The differences in average numbers of taxa between the 1660 sites distributed over Europe were either caused by differences between local environmental factors or by sampling effort, not by temperature, elevation, stream order or latitudinal position. The distribution patterns using all samples, only reference samples, and only degraded samples showed that human stress diminished the natural differences between stream communities and typologies should therefore be based on reference conditions. {\textcopyright} Springer 2006.},

  abstract        = {European countries have defined N1000 national river types and N400 national lake types to implement the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD). In addition, common river and lake types have been defined within regions of Europe for intercalibrating the national classification systems for ecological status of water bodies. However, only a low proportion of national types correspond to these common intercalibration types. This causes uncer- tainty concerningwhether the classification ofecological status is consistent across countries. Therefore, through an extensive dialogue with and data provision from all EU countries, we have developed a generic typology for European rivers and lakes. This new broad typology reflects the natural variability in the most commonly used environmental type descriptors: altitude, size and geology, as well as mean depth for lakes. These broad types capture 60–70{\%} ofall national WFD types including almost 80{\%} ofall European river and lake water bodies in al- most all EU countries and can also be linked to all the common intercalibration types. The typology provides a new framework for large-scale assessments across country borders, as demonstratedwith an assessment ofeco- logical status and pressures based on European data from the 2nd set of river basin management plans. The ty- pology can also be used for a variety of other large-scale assessments, such as reviewing and linking the water body types to habitat types under the Habitats Directive and the European Nature Information System (EUNIS), as well as comparing type-specific limit values for nutrients and other supporting quality elements across countries. Thus, the broad typology can build the basis for all scientific outputs ofmanagerial relevance related to water body types.},

  abstract        = {In the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) a typological framework is defined for assessing the ecological quality of water bodies in the future. The conditions in the Directive impose a strong demand for `new' assessment systems. During the AQEM project an assessment system was developed for European streams using macroinvertebrates. The aim of this study was to test if the typology suggested in the WFD is useful for developing an assessment system for macroinvertebrates in streams. In total 889 streams of 29 stream types were sampled in eight countries all over the major geographical gradients in Europe. These stream types fit the WFD typological demands and fit to the major European geographic regions (ecoregions). The sites included gradients from reference conditions (for the definition see Nijboer et al., 2004) to sites with bad ecological quality. Despite standardisation there were large differences between the participating countries concerning the number of taxa, the number of specimens and the taxonomic resolution. The data, including macroinvertebrates and environmental variables were analysed by using Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). The observed macroinvertebrate distribution largely supported the WFD typological criteria. This means that the major macroinvertebrate distribution patterns in European streams follow climatological and geomorphological conditions and are well distinguished in terms of stream types. Furthermore, it was shown that large scale factors affected the macroinvertebrate distribution even on a very fine scale. Most explanatory variables seemed to be scale independent. Even at a fine scale major factors concerning geology, geomorphology and hydrology added to the species occurrences. Within stream types morphology together with physico-chemistry best explained the macroinvertebrates distribution. In conclusion, the WFD typology is useful for an assessment system for streams using macroinvertebrates. The large scale factors were indeed the variables that explained most of the variation in species composition. But as these factors even strongly act at the scale of stream types, a further refinement is most probably necessary to disentangle typological actors from water quality ones.},

  abstract = {From headwaters to mouth, the physical variables within a river system present a con- tinuous gradient of physical conditions. This gradient should elicit a series of responses within the constituent populations resulting in a continuum of biotic adjustments and consistent patterns of loading, transport, utilization, and storage of organic matter along the length of a river. Based on the energy equilibrium theory of fluvial geomorphologists, we hypothesize that the structural and functional characteristics of stream conununities are adapted to conform to the most probable position or mean state of the physical system. We reason that producer and consumer communities characteristic of a given river reach become established in harmony with the dynamic physical conditions of the channel. In natural stream systems, biological communities can be characterized as forming a temporal continuum of synchronized species replacements. This continuous replacement functions to distribute the utilization of energy inputs over time. Thus, the biological system moves towards a balance between a tendency for efficient use of energy inputs through resource partitioning (food, substrate, etc.) and an opposing tendency for a uniform rate of energy processing throughout the year. We theorize that biological communities developed in natural streams assume processing strategies involving minimum energy loss. Downstream communities are fashioned to capitalize on upstream processing inefficiencies. Both the upstream inefficiency (leakage) and the downstream adjust- ments seem predictable. We propose that this River Continuum Concept provides a frame- work for integrating predictable and observable biological features of lotic systems. Implica- tions of the concept in the areas of structure, function, and stability of riverine ecosystems are discussed.},

Community composition was used to evaluate zoogeographic patterns and functional feeding guilds were used to identify mechanisms potentially affecting such patterns. 3. Stream communities were generally more diverse and species-rich and had a higher proportion of grazers, shredders and passive-filter feeders than lakes. Lake communities had a higher proportion of predators and collector-gatherers. Of the 10 most common taxa, only Leptophlebia mayflies, clams (Sphaeriidae) and the isopod Asellus aquaticus were recorded in both lakes and streams. 4. Among-site variance in macroinvertebrate communities accounted for by regional-scale variables was low (6.4{\%} for lakes and 10.1{\%} for streams), compared with that by local- scale variables (21{\%} for lakes and 37.6{\%} for streams). For lakes, the among-site variance in macroinvertebrate communities was best explained by habitat-scale characteristics followed by ecosystem, riparian, catchment, geographic position and ecoregion. For streams, the variance in macroinvertebrate communities was best explained by ecosystem characteristics followed by habitat, catchment, riparian, ecoregion and geographic position. 5. Conspicuous differences in spatial pattern were revealed between lakes and streams. For lakes, the most unequivocal differences in community composition and function occurred at the transition zone between the mixed forests in the south and the boreal coniferous forests in the north. Surprisingly, streams did not respond as strongly to profound landscape-level differences in climate and vegetation cover. 6. The spatial differences noted between macroinvertebrate communities of lakes and streams may be because of differences in retention of detrital matter. Our findings imply that detrital inputs are qualitatively similar, but that the retention and processing of coarse particulate organic matter was presumably higher in lake littoral regions than in stream riffle habitats. 7. Although our findings support the conjecture that species distribution is determined fundamentally by conditions prevailing at the local-scale, regional factors such as land use/type and the role of history were important and seemingly act as strong determinants of large-scale patterns in biodiversity.},

This, in addition to a data set which appropriately combined different biological elements, enabled a typology to be developed which was far more effective than a System A, CCA-derived or expert opinion-based typology in segregating communities.

At genus level, streams located in the lowlands differ from streams in lower mountainous areas and the Alps, while the two latter groups were undistinguishable. At species level, a clear separation of different stream size classes is visible in the lowlands; a second gradient is related to the bottom substrate. Streams in the Alps can be distinguished from streams in lower mountainous areas at species level. Within the lower mountainous regions a size gradient is detectable, a less obvious gradient indicates catchment geology.

However, unlike for smaller rivers, this assessment is yet less advanced due to the specific complexities of very large river systems. In Europe, this is reflected by the lack of an international large river typology classifying these ecosystems into units with homogenous environmental features. Focussing on European rivers of {\textgreater}10,000 km2 catchment size, we collated datasets describing orographic, geological, geomorphological, hy- drological and climatic features of the riverine environment. These rivers were divided into segments of about 30 km length, and 40 environmental descriptors hardly modifiable by human activities were allocated to each segment. In a subsequent cluster analysis, we identified seven large river types (LRTs) across Europe: Alpine- Influenced rivers; Baltic rivers; Central Lowland rivers; Continental Lowland rivers; Mediterranean rivers; Nordic rivers; Atlantic rivers. These LRTs were compared with existing European bio-geographical classifications and tested using contemporary river sampling data of benthic invertebrates. Our study describes a systematic pan- European typology characterising different types of European very large rivers, reviewed and validated by biological data. This typology represents an essential step in fostering the implementation of bio-assessment methods tailored to very large rivers in Europe.},

The clustering algorithms used are hierarchical, crisp (neural gas, self-organizing maps, hard competitive learning, k-means, maximin-distance, CLARA) and fuzzy (c-means, fuzzy competitive learning). To compare these methods we use two performance measures, namely the correlation coefficient and the weighted Jaccard coefficient (wJC). Both performance coefficients (PCs) clearly show that the neural gas and the k-means algorithm perform significantly better than all the other methods using our setup. For the hierarchical methods the ward linkage algorithm performs best under our simulation design. In conclusion, the neural gas method seems to be the best choice for fMRI cluster analysis, given its correct classification of activated pixels (true positives (TPs)) whilst minimizing the misclassification of inactivated pixels (false positives (FPs)), and in the stability of the results achieved. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract      = {Abstract: Global pressures on freshwater ecosystems are high and rising. Viewed primarily as a resource for humans, current practices of water use have led to catastrophic declines in freshwater species and the degradation of freshwater ecosystems, including their genetic and functional diversity. Approximately three‐quarters of the world's inland wetlands have been lost, one‐third of the 28 000 freshwater species assessed for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List are threatened with extinction, and freshwater vertebrate populations are undergoing declines that are more rapid than those of terrestrial and marine species. This global loss continues unchecked, despite the importance of freshwater ecosystems as a source of clean water, food, livelihoods, recreation, and inspiration. The causes of these declines include hydrological alterations, habitat degradation and loss, overexploitation, invasive species, pollution, and the multiple impacts of climate change. Although there are policy initiatives that aim to protect freshwater life, these are rarely implemented with sufficient conviction and enforcement. Policies that focus on the development and management of fresh waters as a resource for people almost universally neglect the biodiversity that they contain. Here we introduce the Alliance for Freshwater Life, a global initiative, uniting specialists in research, data synthesis, conservation, education and outreach, and policymaking. This expert network aims to provide the critical mass required for the effective representation of freshwater biodiversity at policy meetings, to develop solutions balancing the needs of development and conservation, and to better convey the important role freshwater ecosystems play in human well‐being. Through this united effort we hope to reverse this tide of loss and decline in freshwater biodiversity. We introduce several short‐ and medium‐term actions as examples for making positive change, and invite individuals, organizations, authorities, and governments to join the Alliance for Freshwater Life.},

  abstract        = {Environmental policies increasingly focus on the enhancement of ecological functions across large geographical areas and thus call for biomonitoring tools that assess these functions at large spatial scales. A potential answer to this call would be to use general biological traits of organisms that indicate ecological functions, as such traits will be comparable among communities even across biogeographic regions that differ in their taxonomic composition. Here, we used benthic invertebrates and European running waters as example to illustrate how multiple biological traits could provide a measure for the large-scale biomonitoring of the functional composition of communities. Our measure considered the relative abundance of 63 categories of 11 biological traits (such as size, reproductive and dispersal potential, food and feeding habits) that indicate various ecological functions. Comparing this measure for 10 most natural French reference regions with 37 other most natural regions/stream types scattered across Europe demonstrated an extremely high spatial and temporal stability of the functional composition of natural invertebrate communities at the European scale. Thus, our functional measure corresponds to a fundamental standard for a large-scale biomonitoring tool, which is the stable and reliable indication of the natural reference state across ecoregions that differ more or less in their taxonomic composition. Applying our functional measure to regulated stream sites below dams (in England, Finland and Spain) and to streams receiving sewage inputs (in Wales, Poland and Sardinia) demonstrated highly significant (p {\textless} 10-6) differences in the functional composition between the human-impacted and the natural reference communities. In addition, some of the trait categories responded in a consistently contrasting way to each of the two types (regulation, sewage) of human impact. Consequently, our measure for the functional composition of invertebrate communities provides a first unified European baseline for future stream and river management: it was stable in the most natural but otherwise very different running water types across Europe, it safely indicated human impact, and it could potentially discriminate specific types of human disturbances. As all living organisms have multiple biological traits, our approach could serve to generate, for other types of communities and ecosystems, a set of large-scale biomonitoring tools that use similar and perhaps even comparable measures for the functional community composition.},

We show European maps of ecosystem service capacity, flow (actual use), sustainability and efficiency. Then we ex- plore the relationship between the services and the ecosystem condition at the European scale, considering the ecological status ofaquatic ecosystems, reported under the EU Water Framework Directive, as a measure of the ecosystem integrity and biodiversity. Our results indicate that a higher delivery of the regulating and cultural ecosystem services analysed is mostly correlated with better conditions of aquatic ecosystems. Conversely, the use of provisioning services can result in pressures on the ecosystem. This suggests the importance ofmaintaining good ecological condition of aquatic ecosystems to ensure the delivery of ecosystem services in the future. These results at the continental scale, al- though limited to the ecosystemservices under analysis,might be relevant to considerwhen investing in the pro- tection and restoration ofaquatic ecosystems called for by the current EUwater policy and Biodiversity Strategy and by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals},

  abstract        = {Freshwater blooms of phytoplankton affect public health and ecosystem services globally1,2. Harmful effects of such blooms occur when the intensity of a bloom is too high, or when toxin-producing phytoplankton species are present. Freshwater blooms result in economic losses of more than US{\$}4 billion annually in the United States alone, primarily from harm to aquatic food production, recreation and tourism, and drinking-water supplies3. Studies that document bloom conditions in lakes have either focused only on individual or regional subsets of lakes4–6, or have been limited by a lack of long-term observations7–9. Here we use three decades of high-resolution Landsat 5 satellite imagery to investigate long-term trends in intense summertime near-surface phytoplankton blooms for 71 large lakes globally. We find that peak summertime bloom intensity has increased in most (68 per cent) of the lakes studied, revealing a global exacerbation of bloom conditions. Lakes that have experienced a significant (P {\textless} 0.1) decrease in bloom intensity are rare (8 per cent). The reason behind the increase in phytoplankton bloom intensity remains unclear, however, as temporal trends do not track consistently with temperature, precipitation, fertilizer-use trends or other previously hypothesized drivers. We do find, however, that lakes with a decrease in bloom intensity warmed less compared to other lakes, suggesting that lake warming may already be counteracting management efforts to ameliorate eutrophication10,11. Our findings support calls for water quality management efforts to better account for the interactions between climate change and local hydrological conditions12,13.},

  abstract      = {Recent analyses have reported catastrophic global declines in vertebrate populations1,2. However, the distillation of many trends into a global mean index obscures the variation that can inform conservation measures and can be sensitive to analytical decisions. For example, previous analyses have estimated a mean vertebrate decline of more than 50{\%} since 1970 (Living Planet Index2). Here we show, however, that this estimate is driven by less than 3{\%} of vertebrate populations; if these extremely declining populations are excluded, the global trend switches to an increase. The sensitivity of global mean trends to outliers suggests that more informative indices are needed. We propose an alternative approach, which identifies clusters of extreme decline (or increase) that differ statistically from the majority of population trends. We show that, of taxonomic–geographic systems in the Living Planet Index, 16 systems contain clusters of extreme decline (comprising around 1{\%} of populations; these extreme declines occur disproportionately in larger animals) and 7 contain extreme increases (around 0.4{\%} of populations). The remaining 98.6{\%} of populations across all systems showed no mean global trend. However, when analysed separately, three systems were declining strongly with high certainty (all in the Indo-Pacific region) and seven were declining strongly but with less certainty (mostly reptile and amphibian groups). Accounting for extreme clusters fundamentally alters the interpretation of global vertebrate trends and should be used to help to prioritize conservation efforts.},

  abstract        = {Freshwater ecosystems are among the most diverse and dynamic ecosystems on Earth. At the same time, they are among the most threatened ecosystems but remain underrepresented in biodiversity research and conservation efforts. The rate of decline of vertebrate populations is much higher in freshwaters than in terrestrial or marine realms. Freshwater megafauna (i.e., freshwater animals that can reach a body mass ≥30 kg) are intrinsically prone to extinction due to their large body size, complex habitat requirements and slow life-history strategies such as long life span and late maturity. However, population trends and distribution changes of freshwater megafauna, at continental or global scales, remain unclear. In the present study, we compiled population data of 126 freshwater megafauna species globally from the Living Planet Database and available literature, and distribution data of 44 species inhabiting Europe and the United States from literature and databases of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and NatureServe. We quantified changes in population abundance and distribution range of freshwater megafauna species. Globally, freshwater megafauna populations declined by 88{\%} from 1970 to 2012, with the highest declines in the Indomalaya and Palearctic realms (−99{\%} and −97{\%}, respectively). Among taxonomic groups, mega-fishes exhibited the greatest global decline (−94{\%}). In addition, freshwater megafauna experienced major range contractions. For example, distribution ranges of 42{\%} of all freshwater megafauna species in Europe contracted by more than 40{\%} of historical areas. We highlight the various sources of uncertainty in tracking changes in populations and distributions of freshwater megafauna, such as the lack of monitoring data and taxonomic and spatial biases. The detected trends emphasize the critical plight of freshwater megafauna globally and highlight the broader need for concerted, targeted and timely conservation of freshwater biodiversity.},

  abstract        = {The ongoing biodiversity crisis becomes evident in the widely observed decline in abundance and diversity of species, profound changes in community structure, and shifts in species' phenology. Insects are among the most affected groups, with documented decreases in abundance up to 76{\%} in the last 25–30 years in some terrestrial ecosystems. Identifying the underlying drivers is a major obstacle as most ecosystems are affected by multiple stressors simultaneously and in situ measurements of environmental variables are often miss- ing. In our study, we investigated a headwater stream belonging to the most common stream type in Germany located in a nature reserve with no major anthropogenic impacts except climate change. We used the most comprehensive quantitative long-term data set on aquatic insects available, which includes weekly measurements of species-level insect abundance, daily water temperature and stream discharge as well as measurements of additional physicochemical variables for a 42-year period (1969–2010). Overall, water temperature increased by 1.88 °C and discharge patterns changed significantly. These changes were accompanied by an 81.6{\%} decline in insect abundance, but an increase in richness (+8.5{\%}), Shannon diversity (+22.7{\%}), evenness (+22.4{\%}), and of emergence increased by 15.2 days, whereas the peak of emergence moved 13.4 days earlier. Additionally, we interannual turnover (+34{\%}). Moreover, the community's trophic structure and phenology changed: the duration observed short-term fluctuations ({\textless}5 years) in almost all metrics as well as complex and nonlinear responses of the community toward climate change that would have been missed by simply using snapshot data or shorter time series. Our results indicate that climate change has already altered biotic communities severely even in protected areas, where no other interacting stressors (pollution, habitat fragmentation, etc.) are present. This is a striking example of the scientific value of comprehensive long-term data in capturing the complex responses of communities toward climate change.},

Climate changes can interact with other environmental changes to determine structural and functional attributes of communities. Although such complex interactions are most likely to occur in a multiple-stressor context as frequently encountered in large rivers, they have received little attention in such ecosystems. In this study, we aimed at specifically addressing the issue of relative long-term effects of global and local changes on benthic macroinvertebrate communities in multistressed large rivers. We assessed effects of hydroclimatic vs. water quality factors on invertebrate community structure and composition over 30 years (1979-2008) in the Middle Loire River, France. As observed in other large European rivers, water warming over the three decades (+0.9 °C between 1979-1988 and 1999-2008) and to a lesser extent discharge reduction (-80 m3 s-1) were significantly involved in the disappearance or decrease in taxa typical from fast running, cold waters (e.g. Chloroperlidae and Potamanthidae). They explained also a major part of the appearance and increase of taxa typical from slow flowing or standing waters and warmer temperatures, including invasive species (e.g. Corbicula sp. and Atyaephyra desmarestii). However, this shift towards a generalist and pollution tolerant assemblage was partially confounded by local improvement in water quality (i.e. phosphate input reduction by about two thirds and eutrophication limitation by almost one half), explaining a significant part of the settlement of new pollution-sensitive taxa (e.g. the caddisfly Brachycentridae and Philopotamidae families) during the last years of the study period. The regain in such taxa allowed maintaining a certain level of specialization in the invertebrate community despite climate change effects. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Here, we present and analyse trends in the UK distributions of over 5,000 species of invertebrates, bryophytes and lichens, measured as changes in occupancy. Our results reveal substantial variation in the magnitude, direction and timing of changes over the last 45 years. Just one of the four major groups analysed, terrestrial non-insect invertebrates, exhibits the declining trend reported among vertebrates and butterflies. Both terrestrial insects and the bryophytes and lichens group increased in average occupancy. A striking pattern is found among freshwater species, which have undergone a strong recovery since the mid-1990s after two decades of decline. We show that, while average occupancy among most groups appears to have been stable or increasing, there has been substantial change in the relative commonness and rarity of individual species, indicating considerable turnover in community composition. Additionally, large numbers of species have experienced substantial declines. Our results suggest a more complex pattern of biodiversity change in the United Kingdom than previously reported.},

  abstract      = {Freshwater biodiversity is the over-riding conservation priority during the International Decade for Action - 'Water for Life' - 2005 to 2015. Fresh water makes up only 0.01{\%} of the World's water and approximately 0.8{\%} of the Earth's surface, yet this tiny fraction of global water supports at least 100000 species out of approximately 1.8 million - almost 6{\%} of all described species. Inland waters and freshwater biodiversity constitute a valuable natural resource, in economic, cultural, aesthetic, scientific and educational terms. Their conservation and management are critical to the interests of all humans, nations and governments. Yet this precious heritage is in crisis. Fresh waters are experiencing declines in biodiversity far greater than those in the most affected terrestrial ecosystems, and if trends in human demands for water remain unaltered and species losses continue at current rates, the opportunity to conserve much of the remaining biodiversity in fresh water will vanish before the 'Water for Life' decade ends in 2015. Why is this so, and what is being done about it? This article explores the special features of freshwater habitats and the biodiversity they support that makes them especially vulnerable to human activities. We document threats to global freshwater biodiversity under five headings: overexploitation; water pollution; flow modification; destruction or degradation of habitat; and invasion by exotic species. Their combined and interacting influences have resulted in population declines and range reduction of freshwater biodiversity worldwide. Conservation of biodiversity is complicated by the landscape position of rivers and wetlands as 'receivers' of land-use effluents, and the problems posed by endemism and thus non-substitutability. In addition, in many parts of the world, fresh water is subject to severe competition among multiple human stakeholders. Protection of freshwater biodiversity is perhaps the ultimate conservation challenge because it is influenced by the upstream drainage network, the surrounding land, the riparian zone, and - in the case of migrating aquatic fauna - downstream reaches. Such prerequisites are hardly ever met. Immediate action is needed where opportunities exist to set aside intact lake and river ecosystems within large protected areas. For most of the global land surface, trade-offs between conservation of freshwater biodiversity and human use of ecosystem goods and services are necessary. We advocate continuing attempts to check species loss but, in many situations, urge adoption of a compromise position of management for biodiversity conservation, ecosystem functioning and resilience, and human livelihoods in order to provide a viable long-term basis for freshwater conservation. Recognition of this need will require adoption of a new paradigm for biodiversity protection and freshwater ecosystem management - one that has been appropriately termed 'reconciliation ecology'.},

  abstract        = {Climate and land-use change drive a suite of stressors that shape ecosystems and interact to yield complex ecological responses (that is, additive, antagonistic and synergistic effects). We know little about the spatial scales relevant for the outcomes of such interactions and little about effect sizes. These knowledge gaps need to be filled to underpin future land management decisions or climate mitigation interventions for protecting and restoring freshwater ecosystems. This study combines data across scales from 33 mesocosm experiments with those from 14 river basins and 22 cross-basin studies in Europe, producing 174 combinations of paired-stressor effects on a biological response variable. Generalized linear models showed that only one of the two stressors had a significant effect in 39{\%} of the analysed cases, 28{\%} of the paired-stressor combinations resulted in additive effects and 33{\%} resulted in interactive (antagonistic, synergistic, opposing or reversal) effects. For lakes, the frequencies of additive and interactive effects were similar for all spatial scales addressed, while for rivers these frequencies increased with scale. Nutrient enrichment was the overriding stressor for lakes, with effects generally exceeding those of secondary stressors. For rivers, the effects of nutrient enrichment were dependent on the specific stressor combination and biological response variable. These results vindicate the traditional focus of lake restoration and management on nutrient stress, while highlighting that river management requires more bespoke management solutions. A cross-scale analysis of paired-stressor effects on biological variables of European freshwater ecosystems shows that in 39{\%} of cases, significant effects were limited to single stressors, with nutrient enrichment being the most important of these in lakes. Additive and interactive effects were similarly frequent (ca. 30{\%} each), this frequency being independent of the spatial scale of analysis for lakes but increasing with scale for rivers.},

Which classification methods are most effective according to classification validity evaluators? How do evaluators with different optimality criteria differ in their assessments of classification efficacy? In particular, do evaluators which use geometric criteria (e.g. cluster compactness) and non-geometric evaluators (which rely on diagnostic species) offer similar classification evaluations? Methods: We analysed classifications of two vegetation data-sets produced by eight classification methods. Classification solutions were assessed with five geometric and four non-geometric internal evaluators. We formally introduce three new evaluators: PARTANA, an intuitive variation on evaluators which use the ratio of within/between cluster dissimilarity as the optimality criterion, an adaptation of Morisita's index of niche overlap, and ISAMIC, an algorithm which measures the degree to which species are either always present or always absent within clusters. Results and Conclusions: 1. With the exception of single linkage hierarchical clustering, classifications resulting from the eight methods were often similar. 2. Although evaluators varied in their assessment of best overall classification method, they generally favored three hierarchical agglomerative clustering strategies: flexible beta ($\beta$ = - 0.25), average linkage, and Ward's linkage. 3. Among introduced evaluators PARTANA appears to be an effective geometric strategy which provides assessments similar to C-index and Gamma evaluators. Non-geometric evaluators ISAMIC and Morisita's index demonstrate a strong bias for single linkage solutions. 4. Because non-geometric criteria are of interest to phytosociologists there is a strong need for their continued development for use with vegetation classifications.},

Therefore, quantifying the main assembly processes in various systems and across different datasets has remained challenging. Building on the PER-SIMPER method, we propose a new metric, the dispersal–niche continuum index (DNCI), which estimates whether dispersal or niche processes dominate community assembly and facilitates the comparisons of processes among datasets. The DNCI was tested for robustness using simulations and applied to observational datasets comprising organismal groups with different trophic level and dispersal potential. Based on the robustness tests, the DNCI discriminated the respective contribution of niche and dispersal processes in pairwise comparisons of site groups with less than 40{\%} and 30{\%} differences in their taxa and site numbers, respectively. In the observational datasets, the DNCI suggested that dispersal rather than niche assembly was the dominant assembly process which, however, varied in intensity among organismal groups and study contexts, including spatial scale and ecosystem types. The proposed DNCI measures the relative strength of community assembly processes in a way that is simple, easily quantifiable and comparable across datasets. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the DNCI and provide perspectives for future research.},

  abstract        = {1. Mass effect, allowing species to persist in unfavourable habitats, and dispersal limitation, preventing species from reaching favourable habitats, are the two major dispersal processes. While dispersal limitation can be detected by experimental or modelling techniques, mass effect is more challenging to evaluate, which hampers our ability to disentangle the influence of the environment vs. dispersal on species distribution. This is undesirable for biomonitoring programmes built on known species‐environment relationships. 2. We developed an approach for detection of species influenced by mass effect. We tested it on stream diatoms, a widely used taxonomic group for stream biomonitoring, from four French watersheds. This approach combined (1) an appropriate spatial framework, the Asymmetric Eigenvector Map (AEM), used in species distribution modelling to measure the relative influence of dispersal vs. niche processes, (2) an analysis of negative co‐occurrence patterns to separate mass effect from dispersal limitation, and (3) a measurement of niche breadths to distinguish between non‐spatially structured generalists and species influenced by mass effect. 3. We propose that species characterized by low negative co‐occurrence values, a high correlation to spatial factors and average to low niche breadths are sensitive to mass effect. 4. Synthesis and applications. We suggest that the sensitivity of species towards mass effect should represent a new ecological trait to be considered for fundamental and applied issues concerning ecology and water quality assessment. Almost all of the species identified here as influenced by mass effect are contributing to the calculation of different diatom‐based indices (e.g., Biological Diatom Index or Specific Pollution‐sensitivity Index) and should be treated with caution when assigning ecological status classes to water bodies.},

However, little is known about the prevalence, spatial patterns, interactions with natural environment and co-occurrence of pressures. This study represents the first high-resolution data analysis of human pressures at the European scale, where important pressure criteria for 9330 sampling sites in 14 European countries were analysed. We identified 15 criteria describing major anthropogenic degradation and combined these into a global pressure index by taking additive effects of multiple pressures into account. Rivers are affected by alterations of water quality (59{\%}), hydrology (41{\%}) and morphology (38{\%}). Connectivity is disrupted at the catchment level in 85{\%} and 35{\%} at the river segment level. Approximately 31{\%} of all sites are affected by one, 29{\%} by two, 28{\%} by three and 12{\%} by four pressure groups; only 21{\%} are unaffected. In total, 47{\%} of the sites are multi-impacted. Approximately 90{\%} of lowland rivers are impacted by a combination of all four pressure groups. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors. Water and Environment Journal {\textcopyright} 2011 CIWEM.},

This dose increase can be directly measured with 0.1 mm thin sheets of graphite-loaded TLD's (LiF, Vinten). For Co-60 gamma rays a commercial amalgam filling caused a dose increase by a factor of 1.7. The half value layer for this additional radiation was measured to be approximately 0.4 mm tissue. In order to avoid painful mucous membrane ulcerations which are even more a problem if hyperfractionated treatment schedules are used, we constructed individual dental shields for each patient. As shielding material we used a dental impression material (Optosil P+1 Bayer). This method was tested in 35 patients, in all of them circumscribed mucous membrane ulcerations could be avoided.

  abstract        = {The Water Framework Directive (WFD) is a pioneering piece of legislation that aims to protect and enhance aquatic ecosystems and promote sustainable water use across Europe. There is growing concern that the objective of good status, or higher, in all EU waters by 2027 is a long way from being achieved in many countries. Through questionnaire analysis of almost 100 experts, we provide recommendations to enhance WFD monitoring and assessment systems, improve programmes of measures and further integrate with other sectoral policies. Our analysis highlights that there is great potential to enhance assessment schemes through strategic design of monitoring networks and innovation, such as earth observation. New diagnostic tools that use existing WFD monitoring data, but incorporate novel statistical and trait-based approaches could be used more widely to diagnose the cause of deterioration under conditions of multiple pressures and deliver a hierarchy of solutions for more evidence-driven decisions in river basin management. There is also a growing recognition that measures undertaken in river basin management should deliver multiple benefits across sectors, such as reduced flood risk, and there needs to be robust demonstration studies that evaluate these. Continued efforts in ‘mainstreaming' water policy into other policy sectors is clearly needed to deliver wider success with WFD goals, particularly with agricultural policy. Other key policy areas where a need for stronger integration with water policy was recognised included urban planning (waste water treatment), flooding, climate and energy (hydropower). Having a deadline for attaining the policy objective of good status is important, but even more essential is to have a permanent framework for river basin management that addresses the delays in implementation of measures. This requires a long-term perspective, far beyond the current deadline of 2027.},

We outline the key principles of the intercalibration methodology, review the achievements of intercalibration and discuss its benefits and drawbacks. Less than half of the required intercalibration has been completed, mostly due to a lack of national assessment methods. The process has fostered a scientific debate on ecological classification with important implications for environmental management. Despite a significant level of statistical abstraction, intercalibration yielded a fundamental and unified vision of what constitutes good ecology across Europe, in principle ensuring greater parity in the funds invested to achieve good ecological status. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract  = {The capacity of ecosystems to supply ecosystem services is decreasing. Sustaining this supply requires an understanding of the links between the impacts of pressures introduced by human activities and how this can lead to changes in the supply of services. Here, we apply a novel approach, assessing ‘risk to ecosystem service supply' (RESS), across a range of aquatic ecosystems in seven case studies. We link aggregate impact risk from human activities on ecosystem components, with a relative score of their potential to supply services. The greatest RESS is found where an ecosystem component with a high potential to supply services is subject to high impact risk. In this context, we explore variability in RESS across 99 types of aquatic ecosystem component from 11 realms, ranging from oceanic to wetlands. We explore some causes of variability in the RESS observed, including assessment area, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and population density. We found that Lakes, Rivers, Inlets and Coastal realms had some of the highest RESS, though this was highly dependent on location. We found a positive relationship between impact risk and service supply potential, indicating the ecosystem components we rely on most for services, are also those most at risk. However, variability in this relationship indicates that protecting the supply of ecosystem services alone will not protect all parts of the ecosystem at high risk. Broad socio-economic factors explained some of the variability found in RESS. For example, RESS was positively associated with GDP and artificial and agricultural land use in most realms, highlighting the need to achieve balance between increasing GDP and sustaining ecosystem health and human wellbeing more broadly. This approach can be used for sustainable management of ecosystem service use, to highlight the ecosystem components most critical to supplying services, and those most at risk.},

  abstract        = {The aim of European water policy is to achieve good ecological status in all rivers, lakes, coastal and transitional waters by 2027. Currently, more than half of water bodies are in a degraded condition and nutrient enrichment is one of the main culprits. Therefore, there is a pressing need to establish reliable and comparable nutrient criteria that are consistent with good ecological status. This paper highlights the wide range of nutrient criteria currently in use by Member States of the European Union to support good ecological status and goes on to suggest that inappropriate criteria may be hindering the achievement of good status. Along with a comprehensive overview of nutrient criteria, we provide a critical analysis of the threshold concentrations and approaches by which these are set. We identify four essential issues: (1) Different nutrients (nitrogen and/or phosphorus) are used for different water categories in different countries. (2) The use of different nutrient fractions (total, dissolved inorganic) and statistical summary metrics (e.g., mean, percentiles, seasonal, annual) currently hampers comparability between countries, particularly for rivers, transitional and coastal waters. (3) Wide ranges in nutrient threshold values within shared water body types, in some cases showing more than a 10-fold difference in concentrations. (4) Different approaches used to set threshold nutrient concentrations to define the boundary between “good” and “moderate” ecological status. Expert judgement-based methods resulted in significantly higher (less stringent) good-moderate threshold values compared with data-driven approaches, highlighting the importance of consistent and rigorous approaches to criteria setting. We suggest that further development of nutrient criteria should be based on relationships between ecological status and nutrient concentrations, taking into account the need for comparability between different water categories, water body types within these categories, and countries.},

  abstract        = {Projected climate and environmental change are expected to increase the pressure on global freshwater resources. To prepare for and cope with the related risks, stakeholders need to devise plans for sustainable management of river systems, which in turn requires the identification of management appropriate operational units, such as groups of rivers that share similar environmental and biological characteristics. Ideally, these units are of a manageable size, and are biotically or abiotically distinguishable across a variety of river types. Here, we aim to address this need by presenting a new global river classification framework (GloRiC) to establish a common vocabulary and standardized approach to the development of globally comprehensive and integrated river classifications that can be tailored to different goals and requirements. We define the GloRiC conceptual framework based on five categories of variables: (1) hydrology; (2) physiography and climate; (3) fluvial geomorphology; (4) water chemistry; and (5) aquatic biology. We then apply the framework using hydro-environmental attributes provided by a seamless high-resolution river reach database to create initial instances of three sub-classifications (hydrologic, physio-climatic, and geomorphic) which we ultimately combine into 127 river reach types at the global scale. These supervised classifications utilize a mix of statistical analyses and expert interpretation to identify the classifier variables, the number of classes, and their thresholds. In addition, we also present an unsupervised, multivariable k-means statistical clustering of all river reaches into 30 groups. These first-of-their-kind global river reach classifications at high spatial resolution provide baseline information for a total of 35.9 million kilometers of rivers that have been assessed in this study, and are expected to be particularly useful in remote or data-poor river basins. The GloRiC framework and associated data are primarily designed for broad and rapid applicability in assessments that require stratified analyses of river ecosystem conditions at global and regional scales; smaller-scale applications could follow the same conceptual framework yet use more detailed data sources.},

The test follows a stepwise filtering process involving various numerical-classification tools. Five steps were involved in the testing: (1) evaluation of 322 classification tools using Optim-Class 1; (2) comparison of 20 best performing methods by standardising the various performances across a range of fidelity values using OptimClass 1 and OptimClass 2, to assess the effectiveness of the agglomerative clustering and one divisive technique; (3) calculation and comparison of Uniqueness values and ISAMIC (Indicator Species Analysis Minimising Intermediate Constancies) scores of the resulting classifications; (4) comparison of different classifications by analysing the similarities of the resulting synoptic tables using faithful species, assuming that clusters with similar faithful species represent corresponding vegetation types, and (5) final selection of the single best method based on an expert review of non-geometric internal evaluators, NMDS ordinations and mapped classification solutions. A complex data set, representing many forest vegetation types and consisting of 506 relev{\'{e}}s of 20 m × 20 m sampled in the indigenous forests of Mpumalanga Province (South Africa), was tested. Analysis of Uniqueness provided insight into which methods produced classifications that did not share faithful species. The analysis of synoptic table similarity showed that the classification results were at most 88{\%} similar, while in the most divergent case similarity of only 50{\%} was achieved. OptimClass eliminated poorly performing numerical- classification combinations and highlighted the best performing methods. Yet it was unable to reveal the single best performing method unequivocally across the range of fidelity values used. In such cases, we suggest the solution can be sought in relying on involving external data through expert opinion. Ordinal Clustering and TWINSPAN produced the most outlying classification results. Flexible beta clustering ($\beta$= -0.25) in combination with Bray-Curtis coefficient, standardised by sample unit totals, produced the most informative result for our data set when using informal expert-defined ecological and biogeographical judgement criteria. We recommend that the performance of a set of methods be tested prior to selecting the final classification approach.},

The OPTimal PARTitioning algorithm (OPTPART) optimizes the ratio of within-cluster similarity to among-cluster similarity; the OPTimal SILhouette algorithm (OPTSIL) optimizes the difference between the similarity of each sample to the cluster to which it is assigned and its similarity to the most similar cluster. The algorithms were tested on three vegetation datasets (Mt. Field Massif, Tazmania, Australia; Podyj/Thayatal National Park, Austria/Czech Republic; and Shoshone National Forest, Wyoming, USA) using three dissimilarity/distance matrices (Bray-Curtis, chord distance, and Hellinger distance) and compared to five other commonly used or recently introduced vegetation classification algorithms (flexible-$\beta$, TWINSPAN, PAM, ISOPAM, and K-means) using eight goodness-of-clustering evaluators. Five of the eight evaluators were species-based and operate on the distribution of individual taxa among clusters; three were community-based and operate on the compositional similarity of clusters. OPTPART was initialized from random partitions and from the results of a flexible-$\beta$ classification as the initial partition; OPTSIL was initialized from partitions resulting from OPTPART, flexible-$\beta$, and K-means classifications. Algorithms were ranked from best to worst on each clustering evaluator for each dissimilarity/distance matrix for each dataset, and summarized by median ranks. OPTPART, SIL/OPT (OPTSIL from an OPTPART initial partition), and SIL/FLEX (OPTSIL from a flexible-$\beta$ initial partition) ranked 1–3 respectively for results pooled across all three datasets and dissimilarity/distance matrices. OPTPART, SIL/OPT, and SIL/FLEX consistently ranked 1–3 across the individual datasets, although the order varied slightly by dataset.},

  abstract        = {Classification of waterbodies is a necessary step for aquatic biological assessment. Geographic classes, such as physiographic provinces, marine biogeographic provinces, and ecoregions are frequently used as a classification framework for conducting bioassessments. An alternative to such a priori classification of waterbodies is to let the biological data tell us, using various statistical exploratory techniques to identify classes that do not necessarily conform to geographic stratification. In assessment of new sites, it is often necessary to identify or predict which of several classes the new site may belong to. We classified benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages from streams of Wyoming, using 3 alternative methods: a priori establishment of ecoregions, adaptive modification of the ecoregions, and a posteriori clustering. Classification strengths were compared using similarity dendrograms. Clustering separated the sites better than ecoregions, but the clusters showed strong ecoregional affinities. The modified ecoregions were equal to the clusters in classification strength. We conclude that an iterative process that includes generation of hypotheses, exploratory data analysis, and evaluation and modification of hypotheses is most likely to produce robust classifications, regardless of specific analytical approaches used.},

  abstract        = {The usefulness of ecoregions and catchments (hydrologic units) as bases for classifying aquatic vertebrate assemblages in western Oregon was compared using samples collected by electrofishing from 137 wadeable stream sites distributed evenly throughout the region. The classification strengths of these regionalizations were also compared with neutral-model classifications that were based either on intersite proximities in geographic distance or on intersite similarities in the sampled vertebrate assemblages. The strength of each classification was assessed by the extent to which average within-class assemblage similarities exceeded the average similarity between classes. Mean similarity dendrograms were used as a concise graphical comparison of between- and within-class similarities for alternative classifications, whether they were specified a priori or constructed by clustering. For each a priori classification, a permutation test of the no class structure hypothesis was performed. Classification strengths were assessed using the Sorenson - Dice (presence/absence) and Bray - Curtis (relative abundance) similarity measures, applied to both species-level and family-level assemblage characterizations, as well as for the Bray - Curtis measure applied to a set of 5 assemblage metrics that were designed to reflect stream impairment. For all 5 measures of assemblage similarity, ecoregions had higher classification strengths than did large catchments, and large catchments had about the same strength as a stream-order classification. A catchment classification with 1 of the 3 catchments split into 2 ecoregions separated assemblages as strongly as ecoregions alone. A neutral-model classification based solely on geographic site proximity classified assemblages with about the same strength as ecoregions. Another neutral-model classification of sites, based solely on their sampled assemblages, was at least twice as strong as any of the geographic classifications. Intermediate strength was seen in site groupings derived from a composite measure of between-site assemblage and geographic dissimilarities. Our results suggest that ecoregions and large catchments do indeed have utility for classifying stream vertebrate assemblages. However, much of their classification strength may be a result of spatial autocorrelation effects, rather than ecological factors that determine their particular boundaries. Our similarity analyses also suggest that geographic partitions can be expected to account for only a minor portion of the total variation seen in stream vertebrate assemblages across a large region.},

The dendrograms offer a concise picture of the overall strength of a classification as well as the compactness and isolation of individual classes. Although broadly applicable, the dendrograms were motivated by a need for easily communicated assessments of land classifications that are intended to serve as geographic frameworks for environmental research and management. The dendrograms and other similarity-based tools are applied to a single-factor classification of fish communities sampled along a 281-km section of the Willamette River in the state of Oregon (U.S.). In a second example, the tools are used to evaluate a two-factor classification of fish communities sampled in wadeable streams of Oregon's Cascade Mountains and Willamette Valley.

  abstract        = {Aim: River flow regimes are changing globally as a consequence of human use of freshwater resources. Additionally, rivers are among the most invaded ecosystems. Invasion biology predicts that the establishment and spread of non-native species might be favoured both by new environmental regimes (niche opportunities) and by human-mediated dispersal (propagule pressure). Here, we expand on past research by asking whether these two mechanisms act in isolation or whether they interact to facilitate the spread of non-natives. Location: Conterminous USA. Time period: 1987–2016. Major taxa studied: Freshwater fishes. Methods: First, we examined the geography of riverine fish invasions across 1,148 watersheds spanning the conterminous USA. We focused on species richness and the life-history strategies of non-native (both translocated and exotic) relative to native species pools. Second, we quantified flow regime alteration as the deviation between observed and expected contemporary flow regimes, using a combination of spectral analyses on long-term discharge data and random forest models. We focused on two biologically relevant facets of the flow regime: flow variability and flow seasonality. We also estimated metrics of propagule pressure: recreational fishing pressure and socioeconomic activity. We then compared the strength of evidence associating riverine fish invasions with flow alteration, propagule pressure, and interactions between the two mechanisms. Results: We found that alteration of flow variability and seasonality is widespread across the conterminous U.S. rivers, and has favoured invasions by filtering specific life-history strategies. Importantly, high levels of flow stabilization and propagule pressure interacted: where co-occurring, these two drivers were associated with higher fish invadedness levels than expected based on their individual effects. Main conclusions: Our results underscore the need to consider different drivers of invasion concurrently. Otherwise, important synergistic interactions might be missed that could explain (and guide management strategies to mitigate) the high levels of invasion in fresh waters.},

  abstract  = {More than 500 controlled experiments have collectively suggested that biodiversity loss reduces ecosystem productivity and stability. Yet the importance of biodiversity in sustaining the world's ecosystems remains controversial, largely because of the lack of validation in nature, where strong abiotic forcing and complex interactions are assumed to swamp biodiversity effects. Here we test this assumption by analysing 133 estimates reported in 67 field studies that statistically separated the effects of biodiversity on biomass production from those of abiotic forcing. Contrary to the prevailing opinion of the previous two decades that biodiversity would have rare or weak effects in nature, we show that biomass production increases with species richness in a wide range of wild taxa and ecosystems. In fact, after controlling for environmental covariates, increases in biomass with biodiversity are stronger in nature than has previously been documented in experiments and comparable to or stronger than the effects of other well-known drivers of productivity, including climate and nutrient availability. These results are consistent with the collective experimental evidence that species richness increases community biomass production, and suggest that the role of biodiversity in maintaining productive ecosystems should figure prominently in global change science and policy.},

  abstract      = {Long-term observations on riverine benthic invertebrate communities enable assessments of the potential impacts of global change on stream ecosystems. Besides increasing average temperatures, many studies predict greater temperature extremes and intense precipitation events as a consequence of climate change. In this study we examined long-term observation data (10–32 years) of 26 streams and rivers from four ecoregions in the European Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) network, to investigate invertebrate community responses to changing climatic conditions. We used functional trait and multi-taxonomic analyses and combined examinations of general long-term changes in communities with detailed analyses of the impact of different climatic drivers (i.e., various temperature and precipitation variables) by focusing on the response of communities to climatic conditions of the previous year. Taxa and ecoregions differed substantially in their response to climate change conditions. We did not observe any trend of changes in total taxonomic richness or overall abundance over time or with increasing temperatures, which reflects a compensatory turnover in the composition of communities; sensitive Plecoptera decreased in response to warmer years and Ephemeroptera increased in northern regions. Invasive species increased with an increasing number of extreme days which also caused an apparent upstream community movement. The observed changes in functional feeding group diversity indicate that climate change may be associated with changes in trophic interactions within aquatic food webs. These findings highlight the vulnerability of riverine ecosystems to climate change and emphasize the need to further explore the interactive effects of climate change variables with other local stressors to develop appropriate conservation measures.},

  abstract        = {Global change is increasing biotic homogenization globally, which modifies the functioning of ecosystems. While tendencies towards taxonomic homogenization in biological communities have been extensively studied, functional homogenization remains an understudied facet of biodiversity. Here, we tested four hypotheses related to long-term changes (1991–2016) in the taxonomic and functional arrangement of freshwater macroinvertebrate assemblages across space and possible drivers of these changes. Using data collected annually at 64 river sites in mainland New Zealand, we related temporal changes in taxonomic and functional spatial $\beta$-diversity, and the contribution of individual sites to $\beta$-diversity, to a set of global, regional, catchment and reach-scale environmental descriptors. We observed long-term, mostly climate-induced, temporal trends towards taxonomic homogenization but functional differentiation among macroinvertebrate assemblages. These changes were mainly driven by replacements of species and functional traits among assemblages, rather than nested species loss. In addition, there was no difference between the mean rate of change in the taxonomic and functional facets of $\beta$-diversity. Climatic processes governed overall population and community changes in these freshwater ecosystems, but were amplified by multiple anthropogenic, topographic and biotic drivers of environmental change, acting widely across the landscape. The functional diversification of communities could potentially provide communities with greater stability, resistance and resilience capacity to environmental change, despite ongoing taxonomic homogenization. Therefore, our study highlights a need to further understand temporal trajectories in both taxonomic and functional components of species communities, which could enable a clearer picture of how biodiversity and ecosystems will respond to future global changes.},

The urgency of the mounting freshwater biodiversity crisis necessitates approaches catered to the unique ecology and threats of freshwater life, which are not adequately addressed by current strategies. We present a set of 15 special recommendations for freshwater biodiversity to guide the CBD's post-2020 framework and the 2020 EU strategy based on European case studies, both challenges and successes. Our recommendations cover key outcomes and guiding concepts, enabling conditions and methods of implementation, planning and accountability modalities, and cross-cutting issues. They address topics including invasive species, integrated water resources management, strategic conservation planning, data management, and emerging technologies for freshwater monitoring, among others. These recommendations will enhance the ability of global and European post-2020 biodiversity agreements to halt and reverse the rapid global decline of freshwater biodiversity.},

  abstract        = {According to the Water Framework Directive (WFD), the status of European surface waters is assessed using aquatic organism groups. Here we present an overview of 297 assessment methods, based on a questionnaire survey addressing authorities in all countries implementing the WFD. Twenty-eight countries reported on methods applied to rivers (30{\%}), coastal waters (26{\%}), lakes (25{\%}) and transitional waters (19{\%}). More than half of the methods are based on macroscopic plants (28{\%}) or benthic invertebrates (26{\%}); in addition, phytoplankton (21{\%}), fish (15{\%}) and phytobenthos (10{\%}) were assessed. Countries of Central and Western Europe had developed almost all methods required for the WFD implementation. Two main sampling strategies were discernable: small-scale sampling of the taxonomically diverse groups of benthic invertebrates and phytobenthos that demand elaborate processing, versus large-scale sampling of vast, species-poor plant stands or the mobile fish fauna. About three-quarters of methods identified organisms to species-level while in particular phytoplankton-based methods used class- or phylum-level, or included no taxonomic information. Out of nine metric types distinguished, river methods used more sensitivity and trait metrics while for other water categories abundance metrics prevailed. Fish-based methods showed the highest number of metrics. Fifty-six percent of methods focussed on the detection of eutrophication and organic pollution, with shares decreasing from autotrophic to heterotrophic organism groups: phytoplankton {\textgreater} phytobenthos {\textgreater} macroscopic plants {\textgreater} benthic invertebrates {\textgreater} fish fauna. The order was almost reverse for hydrological or morphological deterioration: fish fauna and macroscopic plants {\textgreater} benthic invertebrates {\textgreater} phytoplankton {\textgreater} phytobenthos. These pressures were mainly assessed by methods applied to rivers and transitional waters. The pressure-impact relationship of about one-third of methods was not tested empirically with methods for transitional waters being the least validated. The strength of relationships differed significantly between organism groups and water categories. The correlation coefficients generally covered a broad range ({\textless}0.4 to {\textgreater}0.8), but on average with the pattern: phytoplankton {\textgreater} macroscopic plants {\textgreater} benthic invertebrates {\textgreater} phytobenthos and fish fauna. In terms of water categories the following order resulted: coastal waters {\textgreater} lakes {\textgreater} transitional waters {\textgreater} rivers. Status boundaries were mostly defined using statistical approaches. We advocate better reflection of the necessary sampling effort and precision, full validations of pressure-impact relationships and an implementation of more ecological components into classification. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

  year      = {2019},
  abstract  = {Typology of waters is defined as a group of water bodies having common natural ecological conditions in terms of geo-morphological, hydrological, physico-chemical, and biological characteristics. The type descriptors are permanent characteristics that do not respond to human activities and represent the fixed abiotic conditions that explain natural variability. For the need of large-scale analysis of ecological status, multiple pressures on rivers and lakes, linkages of water body types to habitat types and for comparison of type-specific limit values for nutrients and other quality elements across countries in Europe, a broad river and lake typology was developed. Descriptors categories are dominant geology, region, river catchment, river altitude, river flow, lake size and mean lake depth. The ranges of descriptors largely follow the system A of Water Framework Directive (WFD) (EC, 2000) and are described in Lyche Solheim et al. (2019).\\
 \\
Various European data sources were used for spatial allocation of rivers and lakes broad types. The starting point was the European Catchments and Rivers Network System (Ecrins) (EEA, 2012), which is organised into sets of spatial thematic layers: lake polygons, river segments (drains), nodes representing intersection of river and catchments and almost 180,000 {\textquotedblleft}Functional Elementary Catchments (FECs){\textquotedblright}. Catchments include {\textquotedblleft}main drains{\textquotedblright} (connecting together the FECs) and {\textquotedblleft}secondary drains{\textquotedblright} (internal within a FEC). We assigned one broad type to all segments belonging to {\textquotedblleft}main drain{\textquotedblright} of each FEC and named them {\textquotedblleft}river segment".\\
\\
The catchment size of river segments in each FEC is defined as the sum of the upstream drainage area and FEC surface area. The upstream drainage area has been derived using data in {\textquotedblleft}Code Arbo{\textquotedblright} in Ecrins database (Globevnik et al., 2017). The altitude of the lower end points of river segments in each FEC is available in Ecrins river database. Lake surface area is obtained from Ecrins lake area attribute {\textquotedblleft}Area{\textquotedblright}. Data on mean lake depth were obtained from Waterbase {\textendash} Water Quality database (EEA, 2016) or estimated from terrain data. The basic map of five geological (geochemical) categories was produced from two thematic maps: bedrock map {\textquotedblleft}International Hydrogeological Map of Europe (IHME 1500$\_$v11){\textquotedblright} (Dutcher et al, 2015) and the soil map of the European Union {\textquotedblleft}SGDBE4{\textquotedblright} (JRC, 2016). The dominant geology for lakes was derived from this map with the overlay procedure. For each FEC we then defined dominant catchment geology (geochemistry) and assigned this geology type to all river segments forming the FEC{\textquotesingle}s main drain. Spatial extent of the Mediterranean region is obtained from spatial layer {\textquotesingle}Biogeographical regions of Europe{\guillemotright} (EEA, 2019). More details on methodology are in Lyche Solheim et al. (2019).},

  abstract        = {Cluster analysis plays vital role in pattern recognition in several fields of science. Silhouette width is a widely used index for assessing the fit of individual objects in the classification, as well as the quality of clusters and the entire classification. Silhouette combines two clustering criteria, compactness and separation, which imply that spherical cluster shapes are preferred over others—a property that can be seen as a disadvantage in the presence of complex, nonspherical clusters, which is common in real situations. We suggest a generalization of the silhouette width using the generalized mean. By changing the p parameter of the generalized mean between −∞ and +∞, several specific summary statistics, including the minimum, maximum, the arithmetic, harmonic, and geometric means, can be reproduced. Implementing the generalized mean in the calculation of silhouette width allows for changing the sensitivity of the index to compactness versus connectedness. With higher sensitivity to connectedness, the preference of silhouette width toward spherical clusters should reduce. We test the performance of the generalized silhouette width on artificial data sets and on the Iris data set. We examine how classifications with different numbers of clusters prepared by different algorithms are evaluated, if p is set to different values. When p was negative, well-separated clusters achieved high silhouette widths despite their elongated or circular shapes. Positive values of p increased the importance of compactness; hence, the preference toward spherical clusters became even more detectable. With low p, single linkage clustering was deemed the most efficient clustering method, while with higher parameter values the performance of group average, complete linkage, and beta flexible with beta = −0.25 seemed better. The generalized silhouette allows for adjusting the contribution of compactness and connectedness criteria, thus avoiding underestimation of clustering efficiency in the presence of clusters with high internal heterogeneity.},

  abstract      = {Metacommunity ecology addresses the situation where sets of local communities are connected by the dispersal of a number of potentially interacting species. Aquatic systems (e.g. lentic versus lotic versus marine) differ from each other in connectivity and environmental heterogeneity, suggesting that metacommunity organisation also differs between major aquatic systems. Here, we review findings from observational field studies on metacommunity organisation in aquatic systems. Species sorting (i.e. species are 'filtered' by environmental factors and occur only at environmentally suitable sites) prevails in aquatic systems, particularly in streams and lakes, but the degree to which dispersal limitation interacts with such environmental control varies among different systems and spatial scales. For example, mainstem rivers and marine coastal systems may be strongly affected by 'mass effects' (i.e. where high dispersal rates homogenise communities to some degree at neighbouring localities, irrespective of their abiotic and biotic environmental conditions), whereas isolated lakes and ponds may be structured by dispersal limitation (i.e. some species do not occur at otherwise-suitable localities simply because sites with potential colonists are too far away). Flow directionality in running waters also differs from water movements in other systems, and this difference may also have effects on the role of dispersal in different aquatic systems. Dispersal limitation typically increases with increasing spatial distance between sites, mass effects potentially increase in importance with decreasing distance between sites, and the dispersal ability of organisms may determine the spatial extents at which species sorting and dispersal processes are most important. A better understanding of the relative roles of species sorting, mass effects and dispersal limitation in affecting aquatic metacommunities requires the following: (i) characterising dispersal rates more directly or adopting better proxies than have been used previously; (ii) considering the nature of aquatic networks; (iii) combining correlative and experimental approaches; (iv) exploring temporal aspects of metacommunity organisation and (v) applying past approaches and statistical methods innovatively for increasing our understanding of metacommunity organisation.},

  abstract      = {Predicting which species will occur together in the future, and where, remains one of the greatest challenges in ecology, and requires a sound understanding of how the abiotic and biotic environments interact with dispersal processes and history across scales. Biotic interactions and their dynamics influence species' relationships to climate, and this also has important implications for predicting future distributions of species. It is already well accepted that biotic interactions shape species' spatial distributions at local spatial extents, but the role of these interactions beyond local extents (e.g. 10 km(2) to global extents) are usually dismissed as unimportant. In this review we consolidate evidence for how biotic interactions shape species distributions beyond local extents and review methods for integrating biotic interactions into species distribution modelling tools. Drawing upon evidence from contemporary and palaeoecological studies of individual species ranges, functional groups, and species richness patterns, we show that biotic interactions have clearly left their mark on species distributions and realised assemblages of species across all spatial extents. We demonstrate this with examples from within and across trophic groups. A range of species distribution modelling tools is available to quantify species environmental relationships and predict species occurrence, such as: (i) integrating pairwise dependencies, (ii) using integrative predictors, and (iii) hybridising species distribution models (SDMs) with dynamic models. These methods have typically only been applied to interacting pairs of species at a single time, require a priori ecological knowledge about which species interact, and due to data paucity must assume that biotic interactions are constant in space and time. To better inform the future development of these models across spatial scales, we call for accelerated collection of spatially and temporally explicit species data. Ideally, these data should be sampled to reflect variation in the underlying environment across large spatial extents, and at fine spatial resolution. Simplified ecosystems where there are relatively few interacting species and sometimes a wealth of existing ecosystem monitoring data (e.g. arctic, alpine or island habitats) offer settings where the development of modelling tools that account for biotic interactions may be less difficult than elsewhere.},

  abstract      = {1. Ecologists often investigate co-occurrence patterns in multi-species data in order to gain insight into the ecological causes of observed co-occurrences. Apart from direct associations between the two species of interest, they may co-occur because of indirect effects, where both species respond to another variable, whether environmental or biotic (e.g. a mediator species). 2. A wide variety of methods are now available for modelling how environmental filtering drives species distributions. In contrast, methods for studying other causes of co-occurence are much more limited. "Graphical" methods, which can be used to study how mediator species impact co-occurrence patterns, have recently been proposed for use in ecology. However, available methods are limited to presence/ absence data or methods assuming multivariate normality, which is problematic when analysing abundances. 3. We propose Gaussian copula graphical models (GCGMs) for studying the effect of mediator species on co-occurence patterns. GCGMs are a flexible type of graphi-cal model which naturally accommodates all data types, for example binary (pres-ence/absence), counts, as well as ordinal data and biomass, in a unified framework. Simulations demonstrate that GCGMs can be applied to a much broader range of data types than the methods currently used in ecology, and perform as well as or better than existing methods in many settings. 4.

  abstract        = {Species interactions are known to structure ecological communities. Still, the influence of climate change on biodiversity has primarily been evaluated by correlating individual species distributions with local climatic descriptors, then extrapolating into future climate scenarios. We ask whether predictions on arctic arthropod response to climate change can be improved by accounting for species interactions. For this, we use a 14-year-long, weekly time series from Greenland, resolved to the species level by mitogenome mapping. During the study period, temperature increased by 2°C and arthropod species richness halved. We show that with abiotic variables alone, we are essentially unable to predict species responses, but with species interactions included, the predictive power of the models improves considerably. Cascading trophic effects thereby emerge as important in structuring biodiversity response to climate change. Given the need to scale up from species-level to community-level projections of biodiversity change, these results represent a major step forward for predictive ecology.},

Additionally, we evaluated the effects of taxonomic resolution and data type (abundance and presence) on results. Methods: Five stream classification systems were used, two based on hydroregions, one based on ecoregions by FEOW, a fourth one based on stream orders and the last one based on clusters of environment variables sampled in 37 streams at Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. We used a randomization test to evaluate differences of richness and abundance, a db-MANOVA to evaluate the differences of species assemblages and Classification Strength (CS) to evaluate the classifications performance. Results: There were differences of richness and abundance among stream classes within each stream classification. The same result was found for community data, except for stream order classifications in family level. We observed that stream classes obtained for each stream classification differed in terms of environment variables (db-MANOVA). The classification based on environment variables showed higher CS values than other classification systems. The taxonomic resolution was important to the observed results. Data on genera level presented CS values 12% higher than family level for cluster classification, and the data type was dependent on the classification system and taxonomic resolution employed. Conclusion: Our results indicate that classifications based on cluster of environment variables was better than other stream classification systems, and similar results using genera level can be obtained for management programs using family resolution in a geographical context similar to this study.},

  abstract        = {Landscape classifications are increasingly being used in conservation planning and biodiversity management, although there is a dearth of studies actually showing concordant patterns between such classifications and biodiversity. We studied the utility of tributary and stream type classifications in accounting for the variability of invertebrate biodiversity in a boreal drainage system. We found that only weak, although significant, differences existed between the studied three tributaries and four stream types in macroinvertebrate assemblage structure, species distributions, and taxonomic richness. Further, the classification strengths, calculated as mean within-group-similarity minus mean between-group-similarity of assemblage structure, were rather low, suggesting that the a priori physical classifications did not effectively describe variability in macroinvertebrate assemblage structure. The low classification strengths likely resulted from the facts that: (i) most stream macroinvertebrate taxa show individualistic responses to environmental gradients; (ii) many taxa occur either across all stream types; or (iii) only sporadically in a given stream type; and (iv) only a few species show high fidelity to a given stream type. However, the significance of the differences in macroinvertebrate assemblage structure and taxonomic richness, as well as a bunch of effective indicator species for different stream types, suggest that such classifications could be used as a preliminary scheme for the conservation planning of running waters. This reasoning is also supported by the evidence from other studies that have found stream size and the distance to upstream lakes to shape considerably the biodiversity of various groups of stream organisms, although no single organism group is likely to show a perfect match with any classification scheme. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The ecological quality of river habitats is increasingly assessed using multiple taxonomic groups. As widely recognised, assessments should be based on the reference condition approach where potentially impaired sites are compared to pristine or near pristine reference sites. To enable valid comparisons, natural variability of habitat characteristics and biotic assemblages should be controlled for, by using either an a priori river typology as suggested by the European Union Water Framework Directive (WFD) or by some other reference framework. We examined a simple WFD river typology, based on two broad-scale ecoregions, catchment area, and geology, as a basis for reference conditions of macroinvertebrates and diatoms in Finland. The ability of this a priori typology to account for natural variation in assemblage composition was evaluated by comparing it with null models (no typology) and with a posteriori clusters ('optimal' biological typology). The biological clusters were clearly more effective than the WFD typology in partitioning assemblage variation for diatoms, whereas differences among the groupings were less evident for macroinvertebrates. Similarly, the number of observed versus expected typespecific taxa (O/E-ratio) was more precise with the a posteriori clusters than with the WFD typology for diatoms, while there were no clear differences among the groupings for macroinvertebrates. For diatoms, the typology was virtually inefficient in improving the precision of O/E from that of the null model. Strong biogeographical patterns in assemblage composition of both biotic groups were evident between and within the two ecoregions. Variation in macroinvertebrate assemblages was primarily related to geographical location and river size, whereas geographical location and water chemistry were the most important environmental factors for diatoms. Our results suggest that simple a priori typologies could be used as a framework for reference condition in freshwater bioassessment. However, when assessments are conducted using multiple taxonomic groups, typologies should be based on factors important for each individual group. {\textcopyright} 2009 E.

Second, most of Europe's very large rivers have been severely altered by human activities such as flood protection, damming and naviga- tion. The aim ofour study is to develop an assessment method for very large rivers by identifying suitable biolog- ical metrics as the basis for multi-metric bioassessment using benthic invertebrates. Based on the pan-European typology ofvery large rivers by Borgwardt et al. (2019), we established a river type-specificassessment approach using invertebrate samples from 25 European countries and 94 very large rivers. The frequency and intensity of eight pressures jointly acting on the sampling sites were described, and a selection ofsuitable invertebrate com- munity metrics were correlated with the pressure intensities to establish pressure-response relationships. The very large river types differ in termsofrelevant pressures and pressure combinations, with the invertebrate com- munities distinctly responding to these pressure patterns. Neozoa dominance correlated strongly with ‘naviga- tion', being a major pressure at very large rivers, which entails severe hydro-morphological alterations such as channelization, riparian vegetation alteration and impoundment. Under combined pressures, a critical commu- nity turnover became evident in terms of neozoa outnumbering EPT taxa and the ratio of hemilimnic invertebrates decreasing. We propose ten bioassessment metrics, including measures of biological diversity as well as newly generated indicators, for the development of a European type-specific assessment method for very large rivers.},

Samples were collected seasonally over 2 year-cycles (2001-2002) at fifteen sampling sites along the Erro River (Ebro River Basin, Spain) during a exhaustive biomonitoring program following the IBMWP-IASPT scoring system protocol routinely applied in Iberia. Despite absolute values of the biotic indices showed high spatio-temporal variation, the IBMWP-IASPT scoring system proved useful because water quality classes were consistent throughout seasons and years as well as along-river. The original macroinvertebrate families' presence/absence data matrix was reduced in a number of ways to conduct different statistical procedures in order to detect and separate the underlying near-natural spatial and temporal gradients of the assemblage composition in the Erro River. Along-river, spatial variation of the macroinvertebrate community composition was well assessed by similarity analysis, which clearly detected physical features on the river (drought-affected reach, gorge, towns and flow gauging weirs). Categorical principal component analysis (CATPCA) synthesized and jointly ordered macroinvertebrate samples in a spatio-temporal gradient in the factorial map defined by the first two principal components providing a parsimonious way to assess the assemblages' variation. These two variation gradients throughout the macroinvertebrate families' occurrence data were subsequently confirmed separately by several correspondence analyses and revealed additional information, as the representative families for each sampling site group and season could be identified. Furthermore, these spatio-temporal gradients were discussed and put in relation with changes in the aquatic habitat (water temperature, conductivity, total dissolved solids, water velocity, channel width, canopy cover, etc.). The near-natural functioning of the Erro River promoted us to emphasize that conservation efforts should aim to maintain the free-flowing as a permanent source of variability. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This will facilitate the comparative assessment of ecological status throughout the European Union. According to the WFD, biologic indices should respond consistently to human impacts, using multimetric approaches and water-quality classification boundaries adjusted to a common set of normative definitions. The European Commission has started an intercalibration exercise to review biologic indices and harmonize class boundaries. We used data from rivers in Spain to compare the IBMWP (Iberian Biological Monitoring Working Party) index, which is commonly used by water authorities in Spain and by several research centers, with the Intercalibration Common Multimetric Index (ICM-Star), which was used as a standard in the intercalibration exercise. We also used data from Spanish rivers to compare the multimetric indices ICM-7 (based on quantitative data) and ICM-9 (based on qualitative data) with the IBMWP. ICM-7 and ICM-9 were proposed by the Mediterranean Geographical Intercalibration Group (Med-GIG). Additionally, we evaluated two new multimetric indices, developed specifically for macroinvertebrate communities inhabiting Mediterranean river systems. One of these is based on quantitative data (ICM-10), while the other is based on qualitative data (ICM-11a). The results show that the IBMWP index responds well to the stressor gradient present in our data, and correlates well with ICM-Star. Moreover, the IBMWP quality class boundaries were consistent with the intercalibration requirements of the WFD. However, multimetric indices showed a more linear relation with the stressor gradient in our data, and less variation in reference values. In addition, they may provide more statistical power for detecting potential environmental impacts. Multimetric indices produced similar results for quantitative and qualitative data. Thus, ICM-10 (also named IMMi-T) and ICM-11a (also named IMMi-L) indices could be used to meet European Commission requirements for assessing the water quality in Spanish Mediterranean rivers.},

  abstract        = {The degradation of aquatic ecosystems, induced by worldwide intensification in the use of both land and aquatic resources, has highlighted the critical need for innovative methods allowing an objective quantification and ranking of anthropogenic pressure effects on aquatic organisms. Such diagnostic tools have a great potential for defining robust management responses to anthropogenic pressures. Our objective was to explore how the outputs of three diagnostic tools (based on benthic diatoms, macroinvertebrates and fishes) could be combined to (i) disentangle the temporal effects of multiple pressures over two decades and (ii) provide policy-relevant information for stream managers and decision makers. The diagnostic tools estimated, using taxonomy- and trait-based metrics, the impairment probabilities of biotic assemblages over time by different pressure categories, describing the alteration of water quality, hydromorphology and land use related to anthropogenic activities, in French streams (number of sites = 312). The main result shows that a large proportion of the time series exhibited no significant temporal patterns over the two decades (61.5% to 87.8%, depending on the used tests). Among time series exhibiting significant change, positive trends in impairment probabilities (i.e., degradation) were less frequent than negative ones, indicating a modest improvement in water quality at national scale over the study period. However, trends can be substantially different according to hydroecoregion and pressure category. The three biological compartments displayed convergent temporal responses according to the pressure category and regional context (e.g., lowland plains vs. mountains, pristine vs. agricultural regions). Altogether, this study proposes a unifying approach to integrate a vast amount of information in a single ecological diagnosis using an unparalleled database on natural and anthropized environments. Strengthening the synthesis of biological information provided by various biological compartments should be a priority before implementing evidence-based sustainable conservation and restoration actions.},

This tool, including conditional tree forest (CTF) models, was built on combinations of benthic macroinvertebrate trait-based metrics for each of sixteen anthropogenic pressure categories.For eleven pressure categories, CTF models have given good impairment risk assessment (i.e. AUC. ≥. 0.70), even at moderate risk level and in a multi-pressure context. The four other models have provided poorer but promising results (AUC. =. 0.67. ±. 0.02).Identifying the potential weight of individual anthropogenic pressures that lead to biotic assemblage impairment in streams under multiple pressure scenario, is a key step for managers to implement appropriate stream restoration programs. Simultaneously considering the whole complexity of bio-ecological adaptations within biotic assemblages subjected to human pressures provides a functional diagnostic tool both (i) ecologically relevant and (ii) efficient for ERA. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {One of the key challenges to understanding patterns of $\beta$ diversity is to disentangle deterministic patterns from stochastic ones. Stochastic processes may mask the influence of deterministic factors on community dynamics, hindering identification of the mechanisms causing variation in community composition. We studied temporal $\beta$ diversity (among-year dissimilarity) of macroinvertebrate communities in near-pristine boreal streams across 14 years. To assess whether the observed $\beta$ diversity deviates from that expected by chance, and to identify processes (deterministic vs. stochastic) through which different explanatory factors affect community variability, we used a null model approach. We observed that at the majority of sites temporal $\beta$ diversity was low indicating high community stability. When stochastic variation was unaccounted for, connectivity was the only variable explaining temporal $\beta$ diversity, with weakly connected sites exhibiting higher community variability through time. After accounting for stochastic effects, connectivity lost importance, suggesting that it was related to temporal $\beta$ diversity via random colonization processes. Instead, $\beta$ diversity was best explained by in-stream vegetation, community variability decreasing with increasing bryophyte cover. These results highlight the potential of stochastic factors to dampen the influence of deterministic processes, affecting our ability to understand and predict changes in biological communities through time. Composition of biological communities at any given site or time is an outcome of deterministic and stochastic processes. Deterministic perspectives, such as the species-sorting concept 1 , view communities as a result of inter-actions between species and their biotic and abiotic environment, with each species having its own predictable niche. Due to environmental differences among habitats, each locality is advantageous for some species while disadvantageous for some others. At the other extreme, stochastic perspectives highlight random colonization and extinction and ecological drift, i.e. random population fluctuations, as mechanisms leading to communities where, in the strictest sense, all species have equal requirements and probability of colonizing a site 2, 3},

  abstract      = {Rising salinity in freshwater ecosystems can affect community composition. Previous studies mainly focused on changes in freshwater communities along gradients of absolute levels of electrical conductivity (EC). However, both geogenic and anthropogenic drivers contribute to the EC level and taxa may regionally be adapted to geogenic EC levels. Therefore, we examined the turnover in freshwater invertebrates along gradients of anthropogenic EC change in two regions of Germany. The anthropogenic change of EC was estimated as the difference between the measured EC and the modeled background EC driven by geochemical and climate variables. Turnover in freshwater invertebrates ($\beta$-diversity) was estimated using the Jaccard index (JI). We found that invertebrate turnover between EC gradient categories is generally greater than 47%, with a maximum of approximately 70% in sites with a more than 0.4 mS cm−1 change compared to the baseline (i.e. no difference between predicted and measured EC). The invertebrates Amphinemura sp., Anomalopterygella chauviniana and Leuctra sp. were reliable indicators of low EC change, whereas Potamopyrgus antipodarum indicated sites with the highest EC change. Variability within categories of EC change was slightly lower than within categories of absolute EC. Elevated nutrient concentrations that are often linked to land use may have contributed to the observed change of the invertebrate richness and can exacerbate effects of EC on communities in water. Overall, our study suggests that the change in EC, quantified as the difference between measured EC and modeled background EC, can be used to examine the response of invertebrate communities to increasing anthropogenic salinity concentrations in rivers. However, due to the strong correlation between EC change and observed EC in our study regions, the response to these two variables was very similar. Further studies in areas where EC change and observed EC are less correlated are required. In addition, such studies should consider the change in specific ions.},

  abstract      = {Landscape and site classifications are increasingly being used in conservation planning and biodiversity management.We examined the utility of a simple typology system for predicting the conservation value of running-water sites in Hungary using aquatic invertebrates. Aquatic invertebrates (444 species) were collected by kick and sweep sampling technique, in a few cases also with a net, at 317 running-water sites covering the entire area of Hungary. On the basis of three criteria (naturalness, altitude and size of catchment area) we obtained a typology scheme distinguishing five running-water types: artificial lowland stream, natural highland river, natural highland stream, natural lowland river and natural lowland stream. We expressed the conservation value of each site using the numbers of native species, unique native species, redlist species, protected species and alien species. Furthermore, the conservation value of each river type was expressed by a measure of beta diversity. Our results show that any interpretation of the effect of a single criterion might be misleading. Consequently, the use of the whole typology system is recommended. The study revealed that all stream types are valuable to a certain extent because they maintain distinct biological communities. We found that the conservation value of artificial watercourses is comparable to that of natural running-water sites. We identified that natural lowland rivers and artificial lowland streams are the ones mostly exposed to species invasions. These findings are essential in maintaining and protecting conservation values of any freshwater ecosystem, and may contribute to management decisions on running waters in Hungary. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.},

  abstract      = {Human-induced reductions in species richness might alter the quality of ecosystem services when the remaining species are not able to substitute the functions provided by extirpated species. We examined how human disturbances (nutrient enrichment, land use intensification, instream habitat degradation and the presence of alien species) influence the species richness of stream invertebrates. Stream invertebrates (425 native species) were collected by kick and sweep sampling technique at 274 stream sites covering the entire area of Hungary. We measured the species richness, functional richness (i. e. number of unique functional roles provided by community members) and functional redundancy (i. e. the functional insurance of the community) using information on the feeding habits of each species. To remove the effect of natural variability, we tested the effect of stressors on the residuals of models relating species richness, functional richness and functional redundancy with natural environmental gradients. Our results showed that species richness was negatively influenced by instream habitat degradation and nutrient enrichment. Independent of the way of quantifying functional richness and functional redundancy, we found that functional richness is more sensitive to human impact than functional redundancy of stream invertebrates. The finding that a reduction of species richness is associated with a loss of unique functional roles (functional richness) is important for conservation issues, because the number of unique functional roles is usually regarded as driver of ecosystem functioning. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

  abstract        = {Stream communities are structured by factors acting over multiple spatial and temporal scales. Identifying what factors are driving spatial patterns in stream communities is a central aim of ecology. Here we used two large European data sets of fish, invertebrates, macrophytes, benthic diatoms and environmental data in two stream groups (lowland and mountain) to determine the importance of variables at different spatial scales (geographical, regional, local) on community structure. Both geographical position and ecoregion were selected first in canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), clearly showing the broad spatial gradients covered in the data set. Secondary predictors (after accounting for spatial and/or ecoregion effects) were similar between stream groups and among the four organism groups. In particular, conductivity and N concentration were strong predictors reflecting catchment land use. Using partial CCA, we assessed the individual importance of the three spatial scales on the community structure of the four organism groups in the two stream groups. The majority of among-site variability (22-29%) was accounted for by local scale variables (e.g. water chemistry and substratum type), with regional and spatial variables accounting 11-13% and 5-6%, respectively. Our findings indicate that the four organism groups are responding similarly to the different levels of spatial scale, implying much redundancy which should be consider when implementing studies of bioassessment. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors, Journal compilation 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Ecoregions provide a holistic framework for flexible, comparative analysis of complex environmental problems. Ecoregions mapping has intellectual foundations in both geography and ecology. However, a hallmark of ecoregions mapping is that it is a truly interdisciplinary endeavor that demands the integration of knowledge from a multitude of sciences. Geographers emphasize the role of place, scale, and both natural and social elements when delineating and characterizing regions. Ecologists tend to focus on environmental processes with special attention given to energy flows and nutrient cycling. Integration of disparate knowledge from the many key sciences has been one of the great challenges of ecoregions mapping, and may lie at the heart of the lack of consensus on the "optimal" approach and methods to use in such work. Through a review of the principal existing US ecoregion maps, issues that should be addressed in order to advance the state of the art are identified. Research related to needs, methods, data sources, data delivery, and validation is needed. It is also important that the academic system foster education so that there is an infusion of new expertise in ecoregion mapping and use.},

To assess effects of these changes on associated biotic communities it is necessary to monitor and report on the status of lotic ecosystems. A variety of stream classification methods are available to assist with these tasks, and such methods attempt to provide a systematic approach to modeling and understanding complex aquatic systems at various spatial and temporal scales. Of the vast number of approaches that exist, it is useful to group them into three main types. The first involves modeling longitudinal species turnover patterns within large drainage basins and relating these patterns to environmental predictors collected at reach and upstream catchment scales; the second uses regionalized hierarchical classification to create multi-scale, spatially homogenous aquatic ecoregions by grouping adjacent catchments together based on environmental similarities; and the third approach groups sites together on the basis of similarities in their environmental conditions both within and between catchments, independent of their geographic location. We review the literature with a focus on more recent classifications to examine the strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches. We identify gaps or problems with the current approaches, and we propose an eight-step heuristic process that may assist with development of more flexible and integrated aquatic classifications based on the current understanding, network thinking, and theoretical underpinnings.},

  abstract      = {ecently, Jennions and M{\o}ller (2003) carried out a meta-analysis on statistical power in the field of behavioral ecology and animal behavior, reviewing 10 leading journals including Behavioral Ecology. Their results showed dismayingly low average statistical power (note that a meta-analytic review of statistical power is different from post hoc power analysis as criticized in Hoenig and Heisey, 2001). The statistical power of a null hypothesis (Ho) significance test is the probability that the test will reject Ho when a research hypothesis (Ha) is true. Knowledge of effect size is particularly important for statistical power analysis (for statistical power analysis, see Cohen, 1988; Nakagawa and Foster, in press). There are many kinds of effect size measures available (e.g., Pearson's r, Cohen's d, Hedges's g), but most of these fall into one of two major types, namely the r family and the d family (Rosenthal, 1994). The r family shows the strength of relationship between two variables while the d family shows the size of difference between two variables. As a benchmark for research planning and evaluation, Cohen (1988) proposed ‘conventional' values for small, medium, and large effects: r =.10,.30, and.50 and d =.20,.50, and.80, respectively (in the way that p values of.05,.01, and.001 are conventional points, although these conventional values of effect size have been criticized; e.g., Rosenthal et al., 2000). The meta-analysis on statistical power by Jennions and M{\o}ller (2003) revealed that, in the field of behavioral ecology and animal behavior, statistical power of less than 20% to detect a small effect and power of less than 50% to detect a medium effect existed. This means, for example, that the average behavioral scientist performing a statistical test has a greater probability of making a Type II error (or {\ss}) (i.e., not rejecting Ho when Ho is false; note that statistical power is equals to 1 – {\ss}) than if they had flipped a coin, when an experiment effect is of medium size (i.e., r =.30, d =.50). Here, I highlight and discuss an implication of this low statistical power on one of the most widely used statistical procedures, Bonferroni correction (Cabin and Mitchell, 2000). Bonferroni corrections are employed to reduce Type I errors (i.e., rejecting Ho when Ho is true) when multiple tests or comparisons are conducted. Two kinds of Bonferroni procedures are commonly used. One is the standard Bonferroni procedure, where a modified significant criterion (/k where k is the number of statistical tests conducted on given data) is used. The other is the sequential Bonferroni procedure, which was introduced by Holm (1979) and popularized in the field of ecology and evolution by Rice (1989) (see these papers for the procedure). For example, in a recent volume of Behavioral Ecology (vol. 13, 2002), nearly one-fifth of papers (23 out of 117) included Bonferroni corrections. Twelve articles employed the standard procedure while 11 articles employed the sequential procedure (10 citing Rice, 1989, and one citing Holm, 1979). A serious problem associated with the standard Bonferroni procedure is a substantial reduction in the statistical power of rejecting an incorrect Ho in each test (e.g., Holm, 1979; Perneger, 1998; Rice, 1989). The sequential Bonferroni procedure also incurs reduction in power, but to a lesser extent (which is the reason that the sequential procedure is used in preference by some researchers; Moran, 2003). Thus, both procedures exacerbate the existing problem of low power, identified by Jennions and M{\o}ller (2003). For example, suppose an experiment where both an experimental group and a control group consist of 30 subjects. After an experimental period, we measure five different variables and conduct a series of t tests on each variable. Even prior to applying Bonferroni corrections, the statistical power of each test to detect a medium effect is 61% (=.05), which is less than a recommended acceptable 80% level (Cohen, 1988). In the field of behavioral ecology and animal behavior, it is usually difficult to use large sample sizes (in many cases, n < 30) because of practical and ethical reasons (see Still, 1992). When standard Bonferroni corrections are applied, the statistical power of each t test drops to as low as 33% (to detect a medium effect at /5 =.01). Although sequential Bonferroni corrections do not reduce the power of the tests to the same extent, on average (33–61% per t test), the probability of making a Type II error for some of the tests ({\ss} = 1 – power, so 39–66%) remains unacceptably high. Furthermore, statistical power would be even lower if we measured more than five variables or if we were interested in detecting a small effect. Bonferroni procedures appear to raise another set of problems. There is no formal consensus for when Bonferroni procedures should be used, even among statisticians (Perneger, 1998). It seems, in some cases, that Bonferroni corrections are applied only when their results remain significant. Some researchers may think that their results are ‘more significant' if the results pass the rigor of Bonferroni corrections, although this is logically incorrect (Cohen, 1990, 1994; Yoccoz, 1991). Many researchers are already reluctant to report nonsignificant results (Jennions and M{\o}ller, 2002a,b). The wide use of Bonferroni procedures may be aggravating the tendency of researchers not to present nonsignificant results, because presentation of more tests with nonsignificant results may make previously ‘significant' results ‘nonsignificant' under Bonferroni procedures. The more detailed research (i.e., research measuring more variables) researchers do, the less probability they have of finding significant results. Moran (2003) recently named this paradox as a hyper-Red Queen phenomenon (see the paper for more discussion on problems with the sequential method). Imagine that we conduct a study where we measure as many relevant variables as possible, 10 variables, for example. We find only two variables statistically significant. Then, what should we do? We could decide to write a paper highlighting these two variables (and not reporting the other eight at all) as if we had hypotheses about the two significant variables in the first place. Subsequently, our paper would be published. Alternatively, we could write a paper including all 10 variables. When the paper is reviewed, referees might tell us that there were no significant results if we had ‘appropriately' employed Bonferroni corrections, so that our study would not be advisable for publication. However, the latter paper is scientifically more important than the former paper. For example, if one wants to conduct a meta-analysis to investigate an overall effect in a specific area of study, the latter paper is five times more informative than the former paper. In the long term, statistical significance of particular tests may be of trivial importance (if not always), although, in the short term, it makes papers publishable. Bonferroni procedures may, in part, be preventing the accumulation of knowledge in the field of behavioral ecology and animal behavior, thus hindering the progress of the field as science. However, it is true that researchers often seem to measure apparently irrelevant variables in their study, unnecessarily expanding a probability of making Type I errors. Therefore, it is understandable that reviewers sometimes have to demand Bonferroni corrections for such studies. As explained above, the use of Bonferroni procedures further reduce power, increasing a Type II error to unacceptable levels, and they may also contribute to publication bias, hindering the advance of the field. Therefore, the use of Bonferroni corrections and the practice of reviewers demanding Bonferroni procedures should be discouraged (and also, researchers should play their part in carefully selecting relevant variables in their study). These problems probably stem from overemphasis on statistical significance (i.e., p values) in journals rather than more emphasis on practical or biological significance (i.e., effect size) (Cohen, 1990). I recommend routine presentation of observed (standardized) effect size, such as Pearson's r and Cohen's d, in journal articles (r and d are readily convertible; Rosenthal, 1994), as also recommended by Stoehr (1999) and Jennions and M{\o}ller (2003)(see these papers for various benefits of reporting effect size; see also Kirk, 1996). Standardized effect sizes are degrees of experimental effects, which are comparable across studies even with different sample sizes (note that p values do not tell us what degree of experimental effect is present; Cohen, 1990, 1994; Yoccoz, 1991). Thus, reporting observed effect size, along with exact p values, allows readers as well as researchers to evaluate the biological importance (and statistical significance) of results. Although presenting standardized effect size is still not common in ecology and evolution, some journals in other disciplines oblige or strongly recommend researchers to present effect size (e.g., Murphy, 1997; Wilkinson and The Task Force on Statistical Inference, 1999). Furthermore, reporting not only effect sizes but also confidence intervals (CIs) for effect sizes may prove more useful (see Thompson, 2002, and references therein for software that calculates CIs for effect sizes), because the CIs for effect sizes can be used to interpret nonsignificant results (see Hoenig and Heisey, 2001; Colegrave and Ruxton, 2003; Jennions and M{\o}ller, 2003; Nakagawa and Foster, in press). Additionally, if research involves a large number of variables, controlling ‘false discovery rate' (FDR; the proportion of rejecting true Hos; cf., Bernoulli equation in Moran, 2003) may be an option rather than controlling the probability of obtaining even one false rejection of Ho (i.e., using Bonferroni corrections), as Garc{\'{i}}a (2003)recently highlighted.

Common pitfalls during application, the statistical properties of many ecological datasets, and the strong control of the tablewise error rate made by the widely used sequential Bonferroni procedures, seem to be responsible for some ‘illogical' results when such corrections are applied. Sharpened Bonferroni-type procedures may alleviate the decrease in power associated to standard methods as the number of tests increases. More powerful methods, based on controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), deserve a more frequent use in ecological studies, especially in those involving large repeated-test tables in which several or many individual null hypotheses have been rejected, and the most significant p-value is relatively large. I conclude that some reasonable control of alpha inflation is required of authors as a safeguard against striking, but spurious findings, which may strongly affect the credibility of ecological research.},

The data are used as input to calculate hydrological indices characterizing stream flow regimes. Both temporal and spatial validations were performed. In addition, GLMs using both the calculated and observed hydrological indices were compared, suggesting that the predicted flow data are adequate for use in predictive ecological models. Accordingly, we provide estimated stream flow as well as a set of 53 hydrological metrics at 1 km grid for the stream network of Germany.

  abstract        = {Background: Benthic invertebrate communities are an integral and longstanding component of stream biomonitoring. However, multiple stressors driven by global change threaten benthic invertebrate communities. In particular, climate warming is expected to disrupt freshwater ecosystems. While an increasing number of studies have shown changes in benthic invertebrate community composition in response to climate warming, the effect on stream assessments has rarely been investigated. As several community composition metrics are also used in stream assessments, we predicted that climate warming would worsen stream assessment results. Therefore, we used a comprehensive data set of 2865 benthic invertebrate samples taken between 2000 and 2014 from small central European low mountain streams. We examined the effects of changes in temperature on common community and stream assessment metrics. We used 31 metrics covering composition, richness, tolerance and function of communities, of which many are used in various stream assessment schemes. Results: Against our expectations, we identified a decreasing air temperature trend of − 0.18 °C over 15 years. This trend was accompanied by significant changes in community composition, for example, increases in species richness and decreases in the community temperature index (CTI). Further, we identified slight concomitant improvements of various globally used stream quality assessment metrics, such as a decreasing saprobic index and an increasing BMWP. Conclusions: While temperature increased by + 0.9 °C during the past 30 years (1985–2014), our 15-year study period (2000–2014) showed a decrease by − 0.18 °C. Therefore, we regard the concomitant improvement in several assessment metrics as a recovery from prior increasing temperatures. In turn, we assume that increases in water temperature will lead to opposite effects and therefore cause declining assessment results. Water managers should be aware of this linkage that in turn could provide a chance to mitigate the effects of global warming by, for example, planting trees along the rivers and the removal of artificial barriers to increase current velocity to minimize a warming effect.},

Location: Seventy- eight wetland ponds in Patagonia (Argentina) covering a study area of 3.5 × 105 km2. Time period: Ponds were sampled once between 2006 and 2014. Major taxa studied: One hundred and fifty- eight taxa of wetland aquatic invertebrates. Methods: We generated two beta diversity matrices (based on flying and non- flying invertebrates) and six predictor matrices, including three environmental distance ma- trices, a topographic distance between ponds, and two wind pairwise matrices differ- ing in wind speed. Using Moran spectral randomization of Mantel (MSR- Mantel) tests (which account for spatial autocorrelation), we assessed the relationship between the response and the predictor matrices. We used a network- constrained version of the nestedness metric based on overlap and decreasing fill (NODF), to assess if wind anisotropy (i.e., direction- dependent) affected community nestedness among ponds. Results: Flying dispersers' dissimilarity was significantly explained by environmen- tal variables, whereas non- flying invertebrates' dissimilarity was not significantly explained by any of the distances tested. When wind direction was ignored, wind speed had a negligible effect on both types of communities, whereas when it was considered a consistent nested pattern emerged, with the eastern ponds (downwind) communities being subsets of those from the western ponds (upwind).},

The data set was comprised of 1 766 104 measurements of 478 pesticides (including metabolites) related to 24 743 samples from 2301 sampling sites. We investigated the influence of agricultural land use, catchment size, as well as precipitation and seasonal dynamics on pesticide risk taking also concentrations below the limit of quantification into account. The exceedances of risk thresholds dropped 3.7-fold at sites with no agriculture. Precipitation increased detection probability by 43%, and concentrations were the highest from April to June. Overall, this indicates that agricultural land use is a major contributor of pesticides in streams. RACs were exceeded in 26% of streams, with the highest exceedances found for neonicotinoid insecticides. We conclude that pesticides from agricultural land use are a major threat to small streams and their biodiversity. To reflect peak concentrations, current pesticide monitoring needs refinement.},

Previous studies analysed the ecological risks of a few pesticide mixtures or were limited to an individual region or crop, whereas a large scale analysis of pesticide mixtures is missing. We analysed routine monitoring data from Germany, France, the Netherlands and the USA comprising a total of 4532 sites and 56,084 sampling occasions with the aim to identify the most frequently detected pesticides, their metabolites and mixtures. The most frequently detected compounds were dominated by herbicides and their metabolites. Mixtures mostly comprised of two up to five compounds, whereas mixtures in the USA and France had clearly less compounds than those of Germany and the Netherlands. The number of detected pesticides and thereby the size of mixtures is positively correlated to the number of measured pesticides (r = 0.57). In contrast, a low relationship was found to the ratio of agricultural areas within the catchment (r = 0.17), and no relationship was found to the size of the catchment (r = 0.06). Overall, our study provides priority mixtures for different countries that may be used for future ecotoxicological studies to improve risk assessment for stream ecosystems.},

  abstract        = {The beta-flexible clustering method has exhibited good recovery performance in the few comparative simulation studies that have included the procedure. Further, the beta-flexible technique has not been examined in a systematic manner over the range of parameter values that can be specified for the method. The present report was designed to provide a more complete study of the recovery characteristics of the method. Artificial data were generated with a wide range of cluster configurations. Each data set was subjected to a series of different techniques for the introduction of error. The results indicate that the beta-flexible method with $\beta$ = −.25 or −.2 generally produces recovery rates that are competitive with the group average and Ward's (1963) technique. When outliers are present in the data, values in the range −.7 ≤ $\beta$ ≤ −.4 are needed. The beta-flexible method showed a more stable or robust performance pattern than the two competing procedures across the differing error conditions. Finally, results on the impact of reduced coverage levels as originally proposed by Edelbrock (1979) are reinterpreted in the light of an improved measure of recovery of true cluster structure. {\textcopyright} 1989, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

  abstract      = {One of the most pervasive concepts in the study of community assembly is the metaphor of the environmental filter, which refers to abiotic factors that prevent the establishment or persistence of species in a particular location. The metaphor has its origins in the study of community change during succession and in plant community dynamics, although it has gained considerable attention recently as part of a surge of interest in functional trait and phylogenetic-based approaches to the study of communities. While the filtering metaphor has clear utility in some circumstances, it has been challenging to reconcile the environmental filtering concept with recent developments in ecological theory related to species coexistence. These advances suggest that the evidence used in many studies to assess environmental filtering is insufficient to distinguish filtering from the outcome of biotic interactions. We re-examine the environmental filtering metaphor from the perspective of coexistence theory. In an effort to move the discussion forward, we present a simple framework for considering the role of the environment in shaping community membership, review the literature to document the evidence typically used in environmental filtering studies and highlight research challenges to address in coming years. The current usage of the environmental filtering term in empirical studies likely overstates the role abiotic tolerances play in shaping community structure. We recommend that the term ‘environmental filtering' only be used to refer to cases where the abiotic environment prevents establishment or persistence in the absence of biotic interactions, although only 15% of the studies in our review presented such evidence. Finally, we urge community ecologists to consider additional mechanisms aside from environmental filtering by which the abiotic environment can shape community pattern.},
